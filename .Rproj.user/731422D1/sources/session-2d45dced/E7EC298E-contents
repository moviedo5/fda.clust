# Introduction

The `fda.clust` package provides specialized clustering methods for functional data. 
Inspired by the functional data analysis framework, it offers tools for:

- Clustering functional data using **functional k-means**, **DBSCAN**, **mean-shift**, and **hierarchical clustering**.
- Validating the quality of the resulting clusters using **internal clustering measures**.
- Access to real-world datasets like **ECG200**, **ECG5000**, and **growth_ldata**.

## Clustering Methods
The following clustering methods are provided:

- `fkmeans`: Functional k-means clustering.
- `fdbscan`: Functional DBSCAN clustering.
- `fmeanshift`: Functional mean-shift clustering.
- `fhclust`: Hierarchical clustering for functional data.

## Datasets
Three datasets are included to demonstrate the use of clustering methods:

- **ECG200**: Contains electrical signals from heartbeats, categorized into two groups: normal and myocardial infarction.
- **ECG5000**: A larger dataset of heartbeats with 5,000 samples, representing heartbeats categorized into four groups.
- **growth_ldata**: Longitudinal growth data from the Berkeley Growth Study, with height measurements of boys and girls.

More information about these datasets is available in their respective documentation.
